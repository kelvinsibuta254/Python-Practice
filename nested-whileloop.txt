is a while loop within a while loop
iterating over a list
you first declare the lists
declare variables i.e. i and j which will represent the index of one item at a time
first initialize the variables e.g
i = 0
j = 0
while i < len(list1): i.e while i < 3:

if i becomes 3, we'll get outside of the loop
increment the value of i
while j < len(list2): i.e. while j < 3:

print(list1[1], list2[j])
increment j by 1 so that we can move to the next item in list 2
add print() statement to ensure it prints on the next line

since i and j are equal to 0
list1[i] = list1[0] and list2[j] = list2[0]
