rows = 5

for i in range(1, rows + 1):
  # Outer loop controls the number of rows
  for j in range(1, i + 1):
    # Inner loop prints asterisks for each row
    print("*", end="")
  print()  # Move to a new line after each row of asterisks


  Here, the outer loop iterates from 1 to the number of rows (rows). 
  The inner loop, nested within the outer loop, iterates from 1 to the 
  current row number (i). This creates a right triangle pattern of asterisks,
  where each row has one more asterisk than the previous one.
